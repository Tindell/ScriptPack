When we began experimenting with large language models several years ago, it quickly became clear that generative AI represents the future of software development. We partnered with OpenAI to create GitHub Copilot, the world\u2019s first at-scale generative AI development tool made with OpenAI\u2019s Codex model, a descendent of GPT-3.\n\nGitHub Copilot started a new age of software development as an AI pair programmer that keeps developers in the flow by auto-completing comments and code. And less than two years since its launch, GitHub Copilot is already writing 46% of code and helps developers code up to 55% faster.\n\nBut AI-powered auto-completion is just the starting point. Our R&D team at GitHub Next has been working to move past the editor and evolve GitHub Copilot into a readily accessible AI assistant throughout the entire development lifecycle. This is GitHub Copilot X\u2014our vision for the future of AI-powered software development. We are not only adopting OpenAI\u2019s new GPT-4 model, but are introducing chat and voice for Copilot, and bringing Copilot to pull requests, the command line, and docs to answer questions on your projects.\n\nWith AI available at every step, we can fundamentally redefine developer productivity. We are reducing boilerplate and manual tasks and making complex work easier across the developer lifecycle. By doing so, we\u2019re enabling every developer to focus all their creativity on the big picture: building the innovation of tomorrow and accelerating human progress, today.\n\n"
